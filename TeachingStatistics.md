This CRAN task view gives information about packages with features that
are designed to assist with the teaching of Statistics. It is **not**
concerned with the teaching of R itself. A few of these packages are
listed in other task views, but only the
`r view("Bayesian")` task view has a section devoted
explicitly to teaching (Bayesian) Statistics.

The packages are grouped into three broad topics: teaching, examination
and packages associated with Statistics books. The latter is for books
that are general enough to be of potential interest to a wide audience
of teachers of Statistics. They should concern models and methods with
wide applicability and not be tied closely to a particular application.

If you think that a package is missing from the list, or have any other
comments or suggestions, then please contact the maintainer, either via
e-mail or by submitting an issue or pull request in the GitHub repository
linked above.

### Teaching

-   `r pkg("Rcmdr", priority = "core")` provides a GUI for R,
    based on the tcltk package. A point-and-click interface loads data
    and calls R functions to perform the kinds of analyses involved in
    introductory Statistics courses. More advanced and specialized
    analysis are also available, some of them via plug-ins. The R
    commands are shown in the console. See the [The R Commander
    homepage](https://socialsciences.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Misc/Rcmdr/) for
    more information.
-   `r pkg("swirl")` uses the R console to provide an
    interactive learning environment for students to learn Statistics.
    Students select courses to download from the
    `r github("swirldev/swirl_courses")` GitHub page and
    are provided with immediate feedback as they work. A variety of
    topics are available, under the general headings of Exploratory Data
    Analysis, Statistical Inference and Regression Models. Teachers can
    author and share their own swirl courses using the
    `r pkg("swirlify")` package. See also the [swirl home
    page.](https://swirlstats.com/)
-   `r pkg("mosaic", priority = "core")` contains a wide
    range of tools to assist in teaching of basic, and more advanced
    ideas and techniques in mathematics, statistics, computation and
    modelling. Key aspects are the provision of functions that enable
    beginners easily to perform tasks that would otherwise be difficult
    and the use of simulation to illustrate randomization-based
    inference. See the [Project MOSAIC homepage](http://www.mosaic-web.org)
    for more information.
-   `r pkg("xplain")` can be used to provide bespoke
    interactive interpretations of the output from statistics functions.
    This information needs to be provided by the instructor in XML
    format and may contain R code, to tailor the explanation to the
    specific results. See the [xplain
    website](http://www.zuckarelli.de/xplain/index.html) for a tutorial
    and cheatsheet.
-   `r pkg("animation", priority = "core")` provides
    functions to produce animations relating to a wide range of topics
    in Statistics, Data Mining and Machine Learning. These animations,
    or a sequence of images generated by the user, may be exported to a
    variety of formats.
-   `r pkg("gganimate")` animates plots produced by
    `r pkg("ggplot2")`. It can be used to render the plots
    into an animation, such as a GIF or MP4 video .
-   `r pkg("smovie")` provides movies to illustrate concepts
    in Statistics. Topics covered are: probability distributions;
    sampling distributions of the mean (cf. central limit theorem), the
    maximum (cf. extremal types theorem) and the (Fisher transformation
    of the) correlation coefficient; simple linear regression;
    hypothesis testing.
-   `r pkg("visualize")` provides graphs of the pdf/pmf of
    various continuous and discrete probability distributions, annotated
    with the mean and variance of the distribution. Shading is used to
    indicate an interval (lower tail, upper tail, two-tailed or a
    user-supplied interval) within which the random variable lies with a
    user-supplied probability.
-   `r pkg("LearnBayes")` provides functions and to
    illustrate the essential ideas of Bayesian inference, such as the
    roles of the prior, likelihood and posterior; posterior predictive
    checking and predictive inference, and several example datasets.
-   `r pkg("TeachingDemos")` Provides a wide range of static
    and interactive plots to demonstrate statistical concepts,
    including: coin tossing and dice rolling; confidence intervals;
    various aspects of hypothesis testing; the central limit theorem;
    maximum likelihood estimation; scatterplot smoothing; histograms;
    correlation and simple linear regression; Box-Cox transformation.
-   `r pkg("distrTeach")` provides plots to illustate the
    Central Limit Theorem (CLT) and the Law of Large Numbers (LLN). The
    effects on the CLT plots of changing inputs can be shown using a
    Tcl/Tk-based widget.
-   `r pkg("learnstats")` uses a console-based menus and
    `r pkg("shiny")` apps to provide interactive plots that
    illustrate key statistical concepts. Topics covered include
    probability areas on density functions, binomial, normal, t and F
    distributions, p-values, QQ-plots and simulation of time series with
    different behaviours.
-   `r pkg("BetaBit")` provides games for students to play
    in the R console, including one that involves data-cleaning and
    regression modelling. See the [BetaBit home
    page](http://betabit.wiki/) .
-   `r pkg("DALEX")` provides functions to explore and
    understand predictive models. The [DALEX GitHub
    page](https://github.com/ModelOriented/DALEX) includes two
    teaching-related showcases.

### Examination

-   `r pkg("exams", priority = "core")` provides a framework
    for the automatic random generation of exams and self-study
    materials from a pool of exercises composed using either Sweave
    (.Rnw) or R markdown (.Rmd) formats. R code can be used to generate
    exercise elements dynamically. Questions can be formatted for use in
    a variety of e-learning platforms or output as documents, for
    example a PDF file, for which. Scans of PDF answer sheets can be
    marked automatically. See also the [R/exams
    homepage](http://www.R-exams.org)
-   `r pkg("ProfessR")` creates multiple choice exams from a
    pool of exercises organised in ASCII test files. Multiple versions
    of an exam can be created by randomizing the questions and the
    choices of answers.
-   `r pkg("TexExamRandomizer")` enables the randomization
    of questions created using LaTeX's document class for preparing
    exams. Spreadsheets containing students' answers can be marked
    automatically.

### Packages associated with Statistics books

The following packages are associated with textbooks that are of
potential interest to a general statistical audience, rather than being
specific to a particular application area. The general principle for
inclusion is that package is likely to be of direct use in the teaching
of statistical methods. Official publisher links are provided where
possible and, in some cases, a link to further resources.
